  <h1 align="center">Datatypes in Javascript</h1>
  <h3>The String Data Type</h3>
  <p>The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var a = "Let's have a cup of coffee."; &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// single quote inside double quotes</dd>
    <dd>var b = 'He said "Hello" and left.';   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// double quotes inside single quotes</dd>
    <dd>var c = 'We\'ll never give up.';       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// escaping single quote with backslash</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <h3>The Number Data Type</h3>
  <p>The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10<sup>-4</sup>).</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var a = 25;         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// integer</dd>
    <dd>var b = 80.5;       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// floating-point number</dd>
    <dd>var c = 4.25e+6;    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000</dd>
    <dd>alert(16 / 0);      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Output: Infinity</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <h3>The Boolean Data Type</h3>
  <p>The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var a = 2, b = 5, c = 10;</dd>
    <dd>alert(b > a) &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Output: true</dd>
    <dd>alert(b > c) &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Output: false</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>The Undefined Data Type</h3>
  <p>The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var a;</dd>
    <dd>var b = "Hello World!";</dd>
    <dd>alert(a) &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Output: undefined</dd>
    <dd>alert(b) &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp// Output: Hello World!</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>The Null Data Type</h3>
  <p>The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var a = null;</dd>
    <dd>alert(a);&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Output: null</dd>
    <dd>var b = "Hello World!"</dd>
    <dd>alert(b);&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Output: Hello World!</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <h3>The Object Data Type</h3>
  <p>The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var car = {</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmodal: "BMW X3",</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcolor: "white",</dd>
    <dd>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdoors: 5 }</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>The Array Data Type</h3>
  <p>An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];</dd>
    <dd>alert(colors[0]);&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   // Output: Red</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>The Function Data Type</h3>
  <p>The function is callable object that executes a block of code. In fact, functions can be used at any place any other value can be used. Functions can be stored in variables, objects, and arrays. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, and functions can be returned from functions. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Example :</dt>
    <dd>var greeting = function(){ </dd>
    <dd>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn "Hello World!"; } </dd><br>
    <dd>alert(typeof greeting)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Output: function</dd>
    <dd>alert(greeting());&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Output: Hello World!</dd>
  </dl>
  
</body>
